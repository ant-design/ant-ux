### Introduction

This is a materials library which assists designers to define, refine and finalise the inter-page logic of their products. At the early stage of the product design process, you can use it to draw the logic diagram between pages. Throughout this process, it can help you visualise and understand product architectures and business processes more easily.

Complementary Tools: OmniGraffle，Sketch，Axure

* OmniGraffle is a software which can help you create precise and beautiful graphics ranging from website wireframes, flow charts, organization structure to illustrations. There are unlimited usage scenarios. For example, you can use it to facilitate thinking process, to visualise brain storm ideas, to draw mind map, to create prototypes of website and PDF files, or use it as a style manager. OmniGraffle provides extensive options for objects, canvases, templates, inspectors, and stencils, fully representing its nature of WYSIWYG. You can also customise your own "Stencils", a group of pre-defined drag-able elements.

* Sketch is a vector graphics editor software to set you on track of UI design.
